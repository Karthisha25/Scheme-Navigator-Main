Scheme Navigator

 Problem:
Many citizens in India are unaware of the government schemes they are eligible for. Navigating government portals can be confusing, especially for students, small business owners , farmers, and women from rural areas.

Solution:
Scheme Navigator is a simple web app that helps users discover government schemes by entering their:
- Age
- Gender
- Income range
- Category (student, MSME, etc.)

The app then filters and displays relevant schemes to them in a user-friendly format.
